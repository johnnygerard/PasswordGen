# PasswordGen

PasswordGen is a UWP application that generates passwords offline.

To install it, visit [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N41PKLFWJNJ).

Details about the way passwords are generated:
- A new password is automatically generated at startup.
- A character group (e.g. lowercase letters) selected means one or more characters from that group.
- A character group switched off means zero character from that group.
- Only ASCII characters are used, except control characters and the space.
